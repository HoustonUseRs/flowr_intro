# flowr_intro

why bother?
- ➡when one needs to wrangle a lot of data
- ➡and there are multiple steps involved
- ➡esp. when some of the steps can be
further broken down and processed in
parallel
- ➡use a computing cluster, submit a web of
jobs

- Effectively process a multi-step pipeline, spawning it across the computing cluster Reproducible and transparent, with cleanly structured execution logs
- Track and re-run flows
- Lean and Portable, with easy installation
- Run the same pipeline in the cloud (using star cluster) OR a local machine Supports multiple cluster computing platforms (torque, lsf, sge, slurm ...)
